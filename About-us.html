      <h2>Our Story</h2>
      <p>
        Our founder Abby is the granddaughter, and daughter to immigrants from
        the societ union who have faced tremendous stuggle with learning English
        while struggling to provide for their family. She has heard countless
        stories of her grandmother Julia expressing how she had to stay up late
        watching movies writing down words, doing all she can to learn the
        language, so her family had a chance in America. Our founder believes no
        one should have to feel the pressures of everyday life, changes,
        immigration, etc. while worrying about English, so through a strong team
        of dedicated coders we were able to bring to the public "Julia's
        SPEECH", a website designed to be your main toolbox for learning
        English, because we believe no one should fear their english skills, but
        rather be empowered by it.
