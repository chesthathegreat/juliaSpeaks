      <h2>Our Story</h2>
      <p>
        Our founder Abby is the granddaughter, and daughter to immigrants from
        the Soviet Union who have faced tremendous struggle with learning
        English while struggling to provide for their family. She has heard
        countless stories of her grandmother Julia expressing how she had to
        stay up late watching movies writing down words, doing all she can to
        learn the language, so her family had a chance in America. Our founder
        believes no one should have to feel the pressures of everyday life,
        changes, immigration, etc. while worrying about English, so through a
        strong team of dedicated coders we were able to bring to the public
        "Julia's SPEECH", a website designed to be your main toolbox for
        learning English, because we believe no one should fear their English
        skills, but rather be empowered by it.

          <p>
            Hello! I am Chestha, one of the coders who worked on this project. I
            decided to be a part of the Julia's SPEECH team in order to make
            learning English more accessible. I also come from a family of
            immigrants, and my dad has always told me stories about how he
            struggled to learn English. I am also very interested in learning
            different languages, currently learning German and Mandarin! I hope
            Julia's SPEECH becomes a platform for many to rely on.

            Hey, I'm Neha! I am passionate about travelling and love exploring
            new places and cultures. As someone who has always valued education
            and the power of communication, I wanted to help create Julia's
            SPEECH to help others to open up new opportunities for them. By
            building this website I hope to make learning English accessible,
            engaging and enjoyable for everyone, no matter where they are in
            their learning journey.

          <h3>Aalaya Reddy Penubolu</h3>
          <p>
            Hey! Aalaya is a current junior in high school, and she absolutely
            loves learning and gardening. In school, she loves to participate 
            in various clubs that involve volunteering, and in her free time, 
            she enjoys reading! Seeing her brother grow up, Aalaya learned that
            as a small child, his gestures were only understood by her family. 
            However, through learning a language, he was understood by many 
            others. She believes that learning English helped her do the same. 
            Aalaya believes that language is an important tool that enables 
            one to communicate with the world. She finds being a part of 
            juliaSpeaks as an amazing opportunity to spread the gift of 
            knowledge and connectivity.
